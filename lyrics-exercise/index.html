<h1> Hannah Sun</h1>
<h2>Lomelda</h2>
&nbsp;
<p>I sent you the sun from my hometown</p>
<p>And Chicago, and Atlanta</p>
<p>Sinking at the sight of your shadow</p>
<p>On the sidewalk in Spain</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Or back in Upstate, was it Jersey?</p>
<p>At the airport to Alaska</p>
<p>Sinking on a call from your hometown</p>
<p>Where they found him tearing through</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Flying through the blue on your old drive</p>
<p>Got some old files, gotta find 'em</p>
<p>Gotta get 'em out, gotta get out</p>
<p>Gotta get good, gotta give</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Sinking in again, it's forever now</p>
<p>Glad you held her, glad you held him</p>
<p>Glad you held me too, though I didn't know how</p>
<p>To be closer to you</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Shadowed by the blue, am I shining?</p>
<p>I am trying to shine</p>
<p>Shine</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Hannah, do no harm</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Hannah, do no harm</p>
<p>No harm, no harm, no harm</p>
<p>Hannah, do no harm, no harm</p>
<p>Hannah, do no harm</p>
<p>No harm, no harm, no harm</p>
