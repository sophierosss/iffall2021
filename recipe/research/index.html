<p>This site is a good reference because the design is simple and very user friendly. There is also a really nice muted color palette and a sans serif font that is very inviting. There are pictures throughout the recipe, and I like that as well</p>

<p>I like this website because it opens with several pictures of the food, including all the ingredients layed out, but it also gives you the option to jump ahead to the recipe. Also, the instructions are given both in their written form, as well as shown through pictures at each step. </p>

<p>To me, this website works really well because it gives you a lot of information while still being easy to digest. First, the show you a picture, title, description, and prep time for the food, and then they jump into a story. They then show a picture and then the recipe itself. The color palette is very simple, and the pictures really complement the feel of the site. Overall, a really sleek and nice design.</p>

<p>This website displays information in s a really interesting way because instead of scrolling vertically, you scroll horizontally to get all the information. Also, the use of color works really well. Everything except the part that your cursor is on remains muted.</p>

<p>This webpage is really compelling because if opens with this hand drawn illustration of an octupul that moves up and down slightly so it looks like it is almsot floating. The also use a lot of headers in a grid-like pattern across the page which keeps things really interesting but also easily digestable.</p>

<p>I think this is a successful website because of the combination of graphic elements and photography. Also, as you scroll there are certain elements that pop up and are animated which is really fun. Pictures also appear beside blocks of text when you scroll, making the website seem interactive.</p>
