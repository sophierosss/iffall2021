        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <p>1. Sophie Ross, Communication Design, Junior</p>
        <p>2. I am really interested in illustration and also find typography really exciting. I have never done any kind of coding before, so I am excited but nervous for this class.</p>
        <p>3. I do not have any prior experience with HTML/CSS/JS. </p>
        <p>4. I hope that I can learn how to create a website that can both look aesthetically nice and function relatively seamlessly.</p>
        <p>5. I think designing on screen will be different because I can't simply erase something if it looks bad, I will need to analyze the code and adjust it.</p>
        <p>6. https://bonjour.paris/en I believe that this is a well designed website becasue it uses simple graphics and a limited color palette, making it feel sleek and sophisticated.</p>
        <p>7. https://www.callbruno.com/en/ This site has clear communication because there are clear avenues to various parts of the site, and it is not confusing. They also utilize visual and written cues for different parts of the site.</p>
        <p>8. https://marxdesign.co.nz This website works well because of its interactive elements, clean and simple design, and a clear menu that allows you to navigate throughout the site without issue.</p>
